Write a python program that is a number guessing game:

* The computer "thinks" about a whole number between 1 and 20
* The user guesses
* The computer tells if the guess was too small, too big or exact.
* If exact the user wins, the program ends. Otherwise the user can guess again.
* At the end of the game print out how many guesses the user needed.
